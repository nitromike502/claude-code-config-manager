# Implementation Outlines Directory

This directory contains detailed implementation outlines created at the end of Phase 1 (before Phase 3 implementation) for complex features.

## Purpose

Implementation outlines help catch architectural issues, data structure mismatches, and design gaps BEFORE code is written, preventing costly debugging cycles.

## When to Create Outlines

- Multi-file changes (3+ files)
- New API endpoints with frontend integration
- Feature parity work (implementing existing feature for different entity type)
- Any work estimated at 2+ hours

## Template

See `docs/guides/IMPLEMENTATION-OUTLINE-GUIDE.md` for complete template and guidance.

## Naming Convention

`STORY-X.X-outline.md` or `TASK-X.X.X-outline.md`

## Examples

- `STORY-7.5-outline.md` - Delete functionality for Skills
- `STORY-8.1-outline.md` - Team Builder feature architecture
